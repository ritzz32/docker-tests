# This Dockerfile is set up to install all the application-specific stuff into

# NOTE: If you don't know what you're doing, it's probably a mistake to 
# blindly hack up this file.

# We need curl, pip, and dnsutils (for nslookup).
RUN apk --no-cache add curl

# Set WORKDIR to /application which is the root of all our apps then COPY 
# only requirements.txt to avoid screwing up Docker caching and causing a
# full reinstall of all dependencies when dependencies are not changed.
